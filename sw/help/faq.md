### Why A Swahili Programming Language?

Learning programming is hard, learning it in a language you are unfamiliar with makes it even more difficult. Thus I made a Swahili programming language to make the learning process a little bit easier.

### Why the name Nuru?

Knowledge is light, and this language intends to be a guiding light into the realm of programming.
