# Hello World

### Example code

Create a file called `salamu.nr` and write the code below:

```go
fanya jina = jaza("Unaitwa nani? ")

andika("Mambo vipi", jina)
```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¡" text="Nuru files MUST end with `nr` or `sw`." />}}

Save the file and run it on your terminal with:

```bash
nuru salamu.nr
```

This is what you should see:

```go
Unaitwa nani? // Fill in your name eg: Juma
Mambo vipi Juma
```

And congratulations, you just wrote your first program in Nuru. Go to the [Tutorials Section]() to learn basic programing concepts with Nuru.
